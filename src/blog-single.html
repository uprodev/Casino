In any event, the first position is set to earn 1000 points for a team; the second position equates to 600 points, and so on, up until the eighth position. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first team/club in the Club championship is slated to earn $7m. $4m is reserved for the second spot and $2m for the third spot. The top sixteen clubs/teams are guaranteed prize money, ranging from $7m to $150k, in the club championship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A further $33.8m is reserved for individual Game championships. This prize money will be divided amongst teams occupying top spots in 22 individual events.  $7.6 million in prize money is reserved for teams competing in qualifying events. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A total of $1.1m will be awarded to MVPs across the events, with the MVP of every tournament earning $50,000.
